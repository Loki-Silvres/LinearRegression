# General Body Meet
Conducted on: 20-08-2023

## Agenda
Creation of a Career Development Centre(CDC) body exclusively for CyberLabs.

## Summary
#Competitive Programming ( a.k.a CP )
Discussion over its importance and redundancy.
#Career Development Centre( a.k.a CDC )
Discussion over the incapability of IIT(ISM)’s CDC’s to reach out to major companies for the various 
divisions of Cyberlabs with regard to internships and placements, leading to an over-reliance on CP for only 
Software Development (SD) offers; concluding on the necessity of having our own CDC body, temporarily 
named as “Cyberlabs Career Nexus”.
